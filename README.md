# üìö BookBuddy Chatbot

This is a simple terminal-based chatbot I made called **BookBuddy**. It's a fun little bot that gives book recommendations based on genre, mood, or author using the LLaMA3 model (via Groq API). The idea was just to make a chatbot that sticks only to books and doesn't answer anything unrelated.

## üí° What It Does

- Recommends books based on:
  - Genre (like romance, thriller, sci-fi, etc.)
  - Mood (happy, dark, emotional, etc.)
  - Author names
- If you ask anything outside of books, it won‚Äôt respond to it.
- Uses the Groq API to access LLaMA3 model for responses.
